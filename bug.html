This error occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with a utility class that doesn't exist or is misspelled.  For example:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 @apply text-red-700 text-typo">
</div>
```

If `text-typo` isn't defined in your Tailwind configuration, you'll get a warning or error (depending on your Tailwind setup and build process).  It might manifest as a missing style, unexpected rendering, or a build failure.
